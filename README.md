### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am PÃ¤rla. 

During the day, I work as an IT consultant. In my spare time, I love learning new things, whatever it is. Currently, I am learning more about web development, mainly JavaScript ðŸŒ±. 

Here are some projects me and my peers have been working on ðŸ‘¯. 

* Weather Map: 
A responsive web application that shows the current weather and the weather forecast of the city the user searched for. The user can add city or multiple cities as a favorite. These selected favorite cities are visualized on a map with a marker. The weather info is fetched using openweathermap api.
